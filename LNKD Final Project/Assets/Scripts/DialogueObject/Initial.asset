  - 'First up ... the galactic ruler ...

    Temu the Hutt!'
  - 'Achuta

    I am Temu the Hutt, the most powerful ruler in all of Huttspace'
  - I love long walks on the desert and gazing at the stars!
  - "I am looking for my consort, my partner in crime, another star to orbit me in
    binary!\r"
  - Seems like a loyal partner.
  - Powerful, too.... but there are many more stars in the sky.
  - 'Or rather...

    on the stage'
  - "Give it up for our next contestant, \nSid the Snake!\r\n"

    dry -"
  - will you be my muse?
  - "I might not be topping the charts but I\u2019d love to top you!"
  - "That\u2019s\u2026 forward."
  - Not as forward as our next contestant.
  - "The Queen of the Sea, the tentacled beauty\u2026 \ngive it up for Sexy Octopus!"
  - "There\u2019s plenty of fish in the sea, but none of them are me..."
  - "I\u2019m Sexy Octopus, \nthe best drag queen in the Marianas Trench."
  - I love fashion, makeup and dancing up a storm.
  - "I know how to have some fun - but now I\u2019m looking for the reel thing."
  - "Looks like she\u2019s quite the catch."
  - 'I hope one of them has caught your eye

    Mr. Reaper...'
  - Now, let the show begin! Who will earn the Kiss of Death?
